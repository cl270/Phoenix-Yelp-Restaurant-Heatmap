## Rationale 
Opening a restaurant can be a risky enterprise, from the amount of initial capital needed, to competition.

This project was an attempt to quantify the ideal location to place a restaurant in a US city (in the current case Phoenix, AZ) based on both the density of restaurants in an area (competition), and the number of Yelp reviews for restaurants in the area (potential customer base).
